# Graph Analysis

Graph analysis adds the **analysis view** to Obsidian which implements a set of algorithms that computes useful relations between
the notes in your vault! Our flagship algorithm is the **Co-citations** panel,
that we describe as a _2nd order backlinks panel_. 

The Graph Analysis view shows a table of note names and numbers, each representing the value of
some graph analysis algorithm on that note in relation to the current note.

e.g.

- `[[A]] is 0.9 Similar to [[B]]`
- `[[A]] has a 0.6 chance of being connected to [[B]]`
- `[[A]] is co-cited with [[B]] 6 times`

## Analysis Types

Graph Analysis currently has 3 different analysis types:

1. Similarity
2. Link Prediction
3. Co-Citations

Each of which implement different algorithms with different purposes.

### Similarity

Similarity is a measure of how similar two notes are based on their
connectedness in the graph (ie. note content is not considered).

Currently, only the Jaccard Similarity measure is implemented.

### Link Prediction

Link Prediction is a measure of the probability that two notes should be
connected based on their other connections in the graph.

Link prediction algorithms include:

1. Adamic Adar
2. Common Neighbours

### Co-Citations

Co-Citations counts the number of time two notes are cited together in the same
note and gives extra weight when the two notes are cited close together.

Think of co-citations as a **2nd-order backlinks** panel: Instead of showing _where_ something is cited, it shows _why_, 
or with _whom_ or _what_ it is cited! 

For example, if `[[C]]` has `[[A]] and [[B]]` in its content, then `[[A]]` and
`[[B]]` will each have a co-citation of one.

Each note with co-citations > 0 is given a drop down menu. Inside each drop
down, you can see which note co-cites those two notes, and the sentence in which
they are co-cited (if in the same sentence), otherwise just the sentence with
the other link.

#### Example use case with daily notes
An example why this is useful is given by @HEmile: 
> I use a lot of daily notes, in which I journal and write about the news of the day. 
> This makes the backlinks panel a bit boring: It only shows on what dates I wrote about some note.
> The Co-Citations algorithm shows me much more! 
> For example, the `Joe Biden` note shows me I usually write about Biden together with `Donald Trump`.
> But if I want to know what I wrote about the relations between Joe Biden and `China`,
> I can just look in the co-citations panel and expand the relation to see the story!

## Settings
In the analysis view, you have the option to choose between different
`Analysis Types`, and different `Algorithms` within those types. 
You can set the default analysis type in the plugin settings. 

There is also the option to hide `Infinity` and `Zero` values.

## Documentation on Algorithms

You can read more about the implemented algorithms, or let us know which you want us to add, over [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/) ðŸ‘€. Information on co-citations can mostly be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-citation). In particular, we implement a variation of [Co-citatition Proximity Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-citation_Proximity_Analysis).
